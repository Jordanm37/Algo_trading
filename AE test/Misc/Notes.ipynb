    "For EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and traditional time series models like ARIMA, it's better to use imputed data. This is because these models rely on the assumption of equally spaced time intervals. You can use interpolation, forward-filling, or other appropriate methods to fill in the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For machine learning models like Random Forest, LightGBM, and LSTM, you can use the original data with missing values. These models can handle irregularly spaced data more effectively and don't rely on the assumption of equally spaced time intervals. However, it's still essential to preprocess and clean your data to ensure that the input features are consistent and meaningful."
