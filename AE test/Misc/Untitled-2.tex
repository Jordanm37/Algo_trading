To prove that the set $S = {z \in \mathbb{C} \mid f(z) \in B}$ is closed, we will show that its complement $S^c = {z \in \mathbb{C} \mid f(z) \notin B}$ is open. Recall that a set is open if for every point $z \in S^c$, there exists an open neighborhood $N_\delta(z)$ such that $N_\delta(z) \subseteq S^c$.

Let $z_0 \in S^c$. This means that $f(z_0) \notin B$. Since $B$ is a closed set, its complement $B^c$ is open. As $f(z_0) \in B^c$, there exists an open neighborhood $N_\varepsilon(f(z_0))$ such that $N_\varepsilon(f(z_0)) \subseteq B^c$.

Now, since $f$ is continuous, for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that for all $z \in \mathbb{C}$ with $|z - z_0| < \delta$, we have $|f(z) - f(z_0)| < \varepsilon$. This means that for all $z \in N_\delta(z_0)$, $f(z) \in N_\varepsilon(f(z_0))$. Since $N_\varepsilon(f(z_0)) \subseteq B^c$, we have $f(z) \notin B$ for all $z \in N_\delta(z_0)$. Therefore, $N_\delta(z_0) \subseteq S^c$.

Since we have shown that for every point $z_0 \in S^c$, there exists an open neighborhood $N_\delta(z_0)$ such that $N_\delta(z_0) \subseteq S^c$, we can conclude that $S^c$ is open. As a result, its complement $S$ is closed.
